        "# Smart Answer — Enhancing enterprise applications with AI powered chatbot\n",
        "\n",
        "Smart Answer, a production-ready enterprise Question and Answer (Q&A) chatbot is designed to provide accurate answers by sourcing knowledge from multiple enterprise applications. It integrates quickly with these applications, speeding up its deployment. Smart Answer operates on both public and smaller, open-source LLMs that can be hosted in-house on consumer-grade hardware, ensuring data security and privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "This usage guide is structured into follows sections: Section 1 delineates the comprehensive solution. Sections 2 to 4 delve into the core components, namely Routing, Retrieval, and Answer Generation. Section 5 highlights several optimizations to enhance answer precision. The overview concludes in Section 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overall Solution\n",
        "Smart Answer is based on Retrieval Augmented Generation, a popular application framework for Generative AI. Figure 1 depicts the application workflow.\n",

        "\n",
        "In a standard enterprise setting, employees rely on a variety of IT applications or tools to complete tasks. Upon receiving a task, an employee typically selects the most suitable tool for the job and then uses it to obtain necessary information. Similarly, when a query is submitted through a chatbot, Smart Answer emulates this human process. It does so by defining a range of “tools,” each representing different enterprise applications equipped with specific knowledge pertinent to potential questions. Smart Answer initially routes the query to the most appropriate ‘tool’ based on their predefined capabilities. This selection is facilitated by a call to LLM, ensuring that the question is directed to the tool best suited to provide relevant information. Routing also identifies parameters required for data retrieval by the chosen tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "The selected tool is specialized for extracting relevant data from a designated data source. This gathered data, referred to as ‘context,’ is then amalgamated with the user’s original query to create an enriched prompt. This enriched prompt is processed by the language model to formulate a response. The chatbot, in turn, presents this response to the user, including links to the data sources for reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is the definition of the base class of a tool\n"
